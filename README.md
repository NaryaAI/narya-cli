# PNM CLI

## Introduction

The pnm command line tool is a utility for building and testing your smart contract project,
and interacting with PNM services.

## Installation

To install `pnm`, download the latest release from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/PwnedNoMore/pnm-cli/releases) and extract the binary to a directory in your `$PATH`.

## Usage

### `pnm init`

Use the `pnm init` subcommand to initialize your PNM project.

This command will install the dependencies and PNM SDK, create test/pnm directory, and setup remapping to use the PNM SDK.

### `pnm test`

Use the `pnm test` subcommand to run [PNM invariant and property tests](https://pwned-no-more.notion.site/Property-test-and-invariant-test-c6b80f6b6136408ba41247c0be561fe2) for your project.

It will compile your project and run the tests, so you don't have to compile it manually.

You can use this command to test if the test cases are written correctly before commit and push.

### `pnm template`

Use the `pnm template` subcommand to work with PNM templates.
PNM templates are a set of pre-written invariant tests that you can use to test your smart contract.
You have to fill in the preprepared getter functions to make it work for your project.
It is a good starting point for writing your own tests.

#### Examples

To list available templates, run:

```shell
$ pnm template
Templates available:
	FundLossTest
	OwnerNotChangedTest
	WithdrawWhatDepositTest
```

To install the `FundLossTest` template, run:

```shell
$ pnm template --install FundLossTest
Installing template: [FundLossTest]
Installed template: [FundLossTest] to [test/pnm/FundLossTest_1671118266.sol].
```

### Troubleshooting

You may see the following error message when you try to run `pnm` in macOS:

> canâ€™t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software

You can right click on the app in your Finder, and then click on `Open`. The system will ask you to allow it. Once allowed, you can run the command in the terminal.
